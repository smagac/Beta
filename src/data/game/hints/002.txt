Hooray~  You crafted something for me!
For actually going through with all this and actually helping me, let me tell you a secret!
The great developer of your reality kind of forgot to remove debug keys from your world
Pressing F5 will soft reset your world back to the introduction sequence.
This can be helpful if your current difficulty is too hard or you want to start over to get a good score
You can do this at any point in time in the world of StoryMode!
Though I don't know why you'd want to use it before you've even really started the game.
Hope you have fun with this secret!  Goodbye~
