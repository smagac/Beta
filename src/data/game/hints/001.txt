Hooray~  You crafted something for me!
For actually going through with all this and actually helping me, let me tell you a secret!
If you press any button between 0-9 you can change the color of the world!
And if you press + or - you can change the contrast of those colors~
You can do this at any point in time in the world of StoryMode, even during the intro scene!
Hope you have fun with this secret!  Goodbye~
