Hooray~  You crafted something for me!
For actually going through with all this and actually helping me, let me tell you a secret!
The great developer of your reality kind of forgot to remove debug keys from your world
Pressing F9 will immediately kill the application
He calls it "The Boss Key" and told me once it's a homage to DOS Games. Whatever that means.
You can do this at any point in time in the world of StoryMode!
Be warned as it's a bit dangerous to use!  Hopefully you won't accidentally bump the key at any point in time~
Hope you have fun with this secret!  Goodbye~
