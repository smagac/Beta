You look a bit grouchy, should I come back another time?

You just finished it literally a second ago?
Haha, gods.  Oh, ya know, the passage of time isn't exactly of universal relevance to us.
It's great that you were able to figure anything out, really.

I feel kind of bad blowing up your home back there, so to make it up to you for serving me so well.

See you in %s ago!
Ta-tah~
