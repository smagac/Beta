StoryMode is a simple roguelike game.
There's more to it than that, though, as you'll probably find out just by playing the game.

#System Requirements
The following specifications are required in order to play properly

    At least Java 1.7 is installed
    A GPU capable of OpenGL ES 2.0
    Recommended 512mb of RAM dedicated for the game
	
    *An internet connection is recommended in order to update the game.

#Playing the Game
Input is rather simple and is designed to have an emphasis on being able to play with one hand.

For Keyboard, things will be following this naming scheme to identify input
    Directions - Arrow keys or WASD
    Accept/Start - Enter or Space
    Cancel - Backspace or Escape
    Focus - Tab or Right Control

## Interacting with Menus
- Focus switches current keyboard focus of multipane menus
- Up/Down navigates through lists
- Left/Right used as incrementing and decrementing, or switching tabs
- Accept will execute the currently selected menu button
- Cancel automatically selects the first menu buttons (usually just reverts choice or exits the menu)

## Dungeoning
Like any classic roguelike, all you gotta do is bump into enemies to attack them.
Movement is turn based, meaning enemies will only move when you do.  Unless you know what you're
doing and your reflexes are god-like, rushing will usually just get you killed really fast.

You can press a Direction key or click around the character to move them in that direction.
- Holding down the key allows for a relaxing pace of actions with turns occuring at a steady rate.
- If you want to speed things up, you can tap rapidly to send off a stream of turns

Hovering your mouse over any enemy sprite will show you their name and current amount of HP.
