You look a bit grouchy, should I come back another time?
Well I'm here because I heard that you completed your last item on the crafting list for me!
You just finished it literally a second ago?
Haha, gods.  Oh, ya know, the passage of time isn't exactly of universal relevance to us.
It's great that you were able to figure anything out, really.

Not to shabby, but there's always room for improvement.
I feel kind of bad blowing up your home back there, so to make it up to you for serving me so well.

See you in %s ago!
Ta-tah~
