The wise speak of a being from a land long since lost to the darkness of time. It was said to have lived its life as an ordinary carpenter, making a great many windows and doors for the people. Secluding itself in its workshop, it chopped, sawed, and smoothed all day and night, never seeming to age and rarely coming out for food. After many years, carpenter became the land's most renowned woodworker and was the source of several of the fine items in the King's dining room.

The carpenter's ambitions extended not only to daily life, but to feats beyond the ken of mortals. With its great age it moved onto greater projects and, eventually, left the public eye altogether, only to return in rumor and story. It is said the carpenter, after perfecting its art, stole and destroyed every door of poor make, leaving many homes completely vulnerable to entry by thieves and ne'er-do-wells.

The doors that met the carpenter's exacting standards were refit with locks of silver and gold, completely impervious to attack and inoperable save for the key that matches. This story is told to young adventurers to explain the tedium of finding keys for important doors, but in reality is likely nothing more than the drunken ramblings of frustrated treasure hunters.
