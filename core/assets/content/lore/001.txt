Tumulchek was once a prosperous kingdom, nestled away in the heart of a lively forest. Relatively docile serpents and snakes were native to the area and caused little trouble until the weather turned chilly. Here lived a humble tailor who sought to cure the serpent problem with needle and thread. He rightfully identified the chill as the source of their irritation, but devised a poor solution. Utilizing the warmest fabrics the kingdom could offer, he crafted many sets of comfy clothes for the serpents.

Despite numerous attempts to get them to wear the little snake suits, not a single one, despite the winter chill, deigned to withdraw itself into their cottony confines. He was bitten a great many times and, over a number of years, developed a complete immunity to venom. His reflexes became remarkable, but the outfits he designed were still awful for snake and human alike.

The tailor never went down in history for his work because his outfits were preposterous, and so was his solution to the kingdom's problems. All of his efforts made him become a fine and daring warrior however, and no beast of teeth or claw frightened him after his failed quest. It is said that the serpents still terrorize Tumulchek to this day, every single winter, with not a single one using his clothes. This is commonly believed to be how socks were invented.
