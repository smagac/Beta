The Order of the Long Groove is a group of specialized warrior-monks, secluded in a monastery high in the mountains. When at home they train their bodies through ritualistic slap bass performances, cultivating an inner power known as Flow. Despite their incredibly peaceful attitude toward life, the Order of the Long Groove is not to be underestimated. In the dungeons deep underground they move with peerless rhythm and subdue their enemies by manipulation of their tempo. Places they fight reverberate with funk for many days and often become parties.

Many times those of other vocations, including adventurers and warriors, venture to the monastery to learn how to harness their inner funk. A famous frost wizard perfected his art there, gaining the title of Brother Chillflow. His might was said to be so great that he could subdue an entire army's will to fight with nothing more than three minutes of funky rhythm and his intrinsically sick moves. His haunting bass lines can sometimes be heard from the peaks of mountains.

Of all of the monks of the order, none have yet managed to become more famous than Father Funkmaxmius. Legends are told of the time he subdued a great wyrm with nothing but the canned heat in his heels and his steadfast belief in the great boogie rhythm. The battle is said to have lasted until sunrise and was finished with a perfectly executed sonic finger-snap, purifying the wyrm's bad vibes and leaving it in the form of a crystal disco ball. In recognition of the Father's efforts a memorial club was founded upon the battleground where the faithful still fervently partake of groove, each and every night.
