Changes since Desura Launch on August 8, 2014
============================
- Crafting is fixed and now lists how much of each kind of item you have in materials
- DLC/User content creation framework is in place, allowing file override and extension of select content.
-- Dungeon background music and new monster definitions are among the first to be supported for DLC
- You can now save and load your game
- Fixed scaling of interface controls on the new game screen
- Fix resizing your window

Changes since Beta 2 Announcement on July 13, 2014
============================
- You can now revisit dungeons by selecting the same file again!
-- UI remembers previously entered files as well as the last directory you were in to make revisiting more convenient
- Loot found in the current dungeon run is now included in loot you can sacrifice
- New Dungeoning HUD across the top of dungeoning is now visible
-- Shows Monsters left, loot gathered, and current floor number
- Upon level up, stats can now be altered through allocating points into them
-- Always start with a standard stat setup, giving you full flexibility of where to grind your character
- A few enemy sprites have been redrawn
- Disabled being able to hover over treasure chests and mimics to see what type they are
-- because that's cheating

#### Backend Changes
- Dungeon multithreading is now better balanced, using only 4 threads and synchronization
- Tons of memory optimizations with handling the dungeon metadata so it is no longer lingering after a floor has been created
-- Combined with the threading fixes, the dungeon scene now leaves the game running at around 200-250mb with a 99 floor dungeon
-- That's a 50% decrease in memory usage
-- File generated dungeon metadata is stored as gzipped tmp files to allow revisiting.  
-- Load time for parsing is near to 0, thus making revisiting dungeons really fast
- Loot is handled better, with a 3-tier inventory hashmap, making it easy to have a temp inventory as well as total cumulative inventory for sacrificing

Changes since Beta Announcement on July 7, 2014
============================
- Difficulty now determines how many crafts you need to make x2.  This way on level 1 difficulty you won't be done with the game after crafting your first required item
- Game is distributed using GetDown by ThreeRings.  This allows you to just download the launcher and always have the latest version whenever you run the game instead of having to constantly check back at the website.
- Wandering in the dungeons now features tweening movement for smoother feeling gameplay
- New background tiles for dungeons are featured because the other ones would occasionally cause rainbowing with tweening due to the spacing of the white pixels
- There is now an end game when you craft all the required goods
- GENDER SELECTION EXISTS.  Choose to be a boy or girl, serving the God Michael or Goddess Joann
- Shift dashing has been removed in favour of now being able to hold down buttons to continuously move
- UI sets mouse scrolling on scrollpanes automatically on hover to make things respond more predictably

#### Backend Changes
- Music for dungeons no longer uses the AssetManager because I didn't feel like having a separate manager just for loading music along absolute paths because of freakin' Window's file path format
- Fixed debug logic that was left in that was starting the player off on the last floor of the dungeon
- Hover over enemy ui element is now contained in each of the render systems to allow for proper scaling of where they should be located.
- Remember to scale render systems in dungeons when resizing the screen.  My b for anyone who tried the earliest of betas in fullscreen mode
- some gpus don't like f being appened to numbers in GLSL (AMD APUs).  Remove f and just use standard decimal values in the fragment shader to fix this issue
- Entities don't delete from the world until the next cycle.  Compensate for this by not processing entities with 0 hp.  Also means we don't pointlessly process treasure chests thinking they can move for fight.
- Multiple highlight in craft menu when items have same base type is fixed by overriding equals in Craftable objects
- Dungeon loading is now multithreaded in hopes of lightening the load of things (I probably have too many threads now, though.  Could be optimized more)

Changes since TMG Alpha 2014
============================
- When selecting a compatible audio (mp3, ogg, wav) to explore, the song will play in the background
- File Navigation has been fixed to use absolute paths, allowing you to explore your entire filesystem instead of just your home folder
- File Navigation list is now properly sorted alphabetically in folder-file order
- Palette System has been rewritten and now features an original Gameboy green-scale and Virtualboy red-scale alternative palettes
- Enemies now move smarter and in a more balanced fashion
- Enemies now only move in 4 directions, just like you, so you can no longer be chased or attacked diagonally
- Goddess now shows up and gives you a random hint about the game's "secrets" after crafting your first required item
- Dungeons are now larger and more threatening the deeper you go
- To help curb annoying load times and seemingly visible stalling, loading screens have been implemented
- Loading screens still have access to Boss keys, allowing you to change palette and restart the game even during loading
- Plenty of UI fixes, such as the log box for combat and treasure actually scrolling when new events happen
- Moving your mouse over an enemy shows their name and current hp in a tool-tip above their head
- Clicking within the dungeon display will move the character in the direction of the mouse
- Loot has been added by way of a treasure chest looking enemy with 0 stats, allowing for killing it instantly and getting the loot
- Loot is balanced to try and generate in rooms where there are less enemies to give you reason to search all of the floor
- In addition to loot enemies, occasionally mimics appear!
- Certain enemies are passive, allowing them to not chase after you/become agro until you hit them
- Certain enemies now have custom death messages, such as Michael Bays and Treasure Chests

#### Backend Changes
- Secret keys have been changed.  If you were using F9 to soft reset the game, be careful.  I have fallen victim to the habit as well, so no worries, I understand.  F9 now just tries to kill the application.
- Global key listener allows for "Secret Keys" to be accessed anywhere, instead of sloppily being inserted within the main loop
- All screens now extend a base "Scene" class for consistency
- All UIs extend a "UI" class, with all game uis such as the town and dungeon extending "GameUI" class
- Palette managing now uses 2 tones, 1 for shadows one for highlights
- The game now uses a custom dependency injection solution using representing of the system as services in order to help prevent accidents from happening with accessing things in messy ways.  SceneManager automates this by assigning the main runner into new Scenes's public fields annotated with @Inject as the specified service type
- Due to the large sizes of dungeons, they now are loaded asynchronously as a resource
- loading screens have been added
- Monsters have a level 1 and level 100 value to stats, with a linear slope between the values designating their stats the deeper you go
- Additionally, Passive, Death message, and Exp values have been added to the enemy specification
- LibGDX version used has been upgraded to 1.2.0

TODO List of Features
=============================
- Enemies at higher levels should have a chance of turning into a treasure chest upon dying to provide extra loot

If you read all this, thank you, it means a lot to me that you actually are interested in the development of StoryMode

Have fun with the Beta, good luck, and be sure to break as much as you can for me!
