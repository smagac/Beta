# Notice
Since this is the commit history before StoryMode was released on Steam, that also means it's missing over a year's worth of updates and bug fixes.  Do not expect the game to work perfectly out of the box.  In fact, the latest commit was made shortly after switching the project over to Gradle, so I know it won't work without some tweaking to some files (specifically the file-paths to tilesets).

I will not be accepting any bugfixes or pull-requests to this.  At the current time I do not intend on pushing any additional commits to this repository.  Feel free to fork it and do whatever you want, the official closed-source version with new features and bugfixes will continue to be available on Steam and itch.io.

I hope that this code base will serve as a good base for some people or as learning material for others.
