Hooray~  You crafted something for me!
For actually going through with all this and actually helping me, let me tell you a secret!
The great developer of your reality kind of forgot to remove debug keys from your world
Pressing F6 will immediately throw you into a game session of level 3 difficulty.
It's great if you want to skip the cool cinematic and my blabbering mouth at the beginning of the game.
Though I don't know why you'd ever want to do that!
Like most other secrets, you can use this key at any point in the world of StoryMode!
Hope you have fun with this secret!  Goodbye~
