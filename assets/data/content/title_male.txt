==== Act 1 of 0 ====
Wake up!
What's your name?
What do you mean that's none of my business?
Listen here, to the demands of the Crafting Goddess Joann!
I have plenty of items that need crafting, and I know you are just the kind of person who likes to do that sort of thing.
Look, I know you're busy, but you must also realize that as I am a Goddess speaking to you, your life must be in some kind of peril.
...or maybe I'm just afraid of dungeons.
The items that I need can only be found in your world of The FileSystem.
I'm a transdimensional being, I can't just go on down to your planet and take what I want willy-nilly!  So that's where you come in.
You're a brave adventurer!  You like dungeons!  So let's make a deal.
If you can gather the materials, and craft this list of items for me, I'll keep you alive no matter what.
Of course that does take some of my goddess powers to maintain.  I might require some sacrifices to keep you rejuvenated whenever you want.
No no, nothing like your eyes or legs.  Sheesh, I'm the Crafting Goddess, not the War Goddess.  You humans are so silly.
You can sacrifice some of your loot if you ever need healing or a quick way back home.
You're also free to keep any extra loot and craft additional items in the process.  I'm not the only one who loves hand-made things.
So how about it?  A deal?
Good!  It's settled then!  
(As if I'd let a human like you tell me no...)
Today marks the beginning of your long life of servitude to me!
So I'll leave you with one last bit of advice:
Be wary while adventuring for materials.  
Certain items can only be obtained from certain kinds of files.
Keep that in mind while picking where you want to go.
