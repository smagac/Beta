Wake up!
Hey babe, what's your name?
What do you mean that's none of my business?
Listen here, to the demands of the studly and groovy Crafting God Michael!
I have plenty of items that need crafting, and I know you are just the kind of person who likes to do that sort of thing.
Look, I know you're busy, but you must also realize that since I am a God speaking to you, then your life must be in some kind of great peril.
...or maybe I just want to sit at home watching tv instead of going into some dungeons.
Also, the materials that I need can only be found in your world of The FileSystem.
As your human eyes can see, I am a beautiful and magnificent trans-dimensional being!  
I can't just go on down to your planet and take what I want with no repercussions!  
So that's where you come in.
You're a brave adventurer!  You like dungeons, I hope!  So let's make a deal.
If you can gather the materials, and craft this list of items for me, I'll keep you alive no matter what.
Of course that does take some of my sexy god powers to maintain.  I might require some sacrifices to keep you rejuvenated whenever you want.
No no, nothing like your body.  Ugh, blood sacrifices are so last season.
You can sacrifice some of your loot if you ever need healing or a quick way back home.  I love free stuff!
You're also free to keep any extra loot and craft additional items in the process.  I'm not the only one who loves hand-made things.
So how about it?  A deal?
Good!  It's settled then!  
(I would have just made you do it even if you said no...)
And thus today marks the beginning of your long life of servitude to the most handsome of gods, Me!
Oh, but I guess I should give you a piece of advice:
You should be wary while adventuring for materials.  
Certain items can only be obtained from certain kinds of files.
Keep that in mind while picking where you want to go.
